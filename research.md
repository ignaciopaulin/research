## Evolution of behavioral courtship signals in Trinidadian guppies

Recorded courtship displays of wild male guppies across rivers in Trinidad with varying predation levels.
Using image detection and behavioral decomposition to analyze the postural dynamics of the sigmoid display
and understand how courtship behavior has been shaped by ecological and evolutionary pressures

- **Location**: Trinidad & Tobago  
- **Techniques**: Automated image detection
